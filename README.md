# MOMO

MoMo ( MOnarch MOnitor) is a Vue.js demo app for an application of the job kind.

## Kia ora,

If you are reading this, thank you kindly for your time! I did not have a Vue project at hand that I could 
share, so I did a little hackaton over the weekend instead.

Due to time restrictions I tried to spread my time and efforts over a range of aspects in 
the development process, from UI/UX to DX. This is by no means a finished product, but I hope this
project can serve as a 'sneak preview' of my code style and capabilities.

__This hackaton was made possible by coffee, the bad weather and Yaeji ♬♫♪◖(●◡●)◗♪♫♬__
