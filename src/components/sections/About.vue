                MoMo is a Vue.js demo app for an application of the job kind. I
                did not have a Vue project at hand that I could share, so I did
                a little hackaton over the weekend instead.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to time restrictions I had to prioritise some aspects over
                others, this is not a finished product. However, I hope this
                project gives you a bit of an indication of my code style and
                capabilities.

                below.

              <h3>Okay, but what is it though?</h3>
              <p>
                Every spring and summer I have monarch eggs on my milkweed and
                religiously track everything that's happening on the plants. On
                a notepad...
              </p>
              <p>
                Manually writing these notes is kind of annoying and so I've
                wanted to create this simple app for a while now, so I took this
                opportunity to just get started on it :)
